    redux  ==>>  It is a way to trigger changes in the application's state. 
                   Redux is a popular state management library for React

    Dispatch: Dispatching an action means sending it to the store or state management system. 
             In Redux, you use the dispatch function provided by the store to dispatch actions:

    Dispatching actions allows you to manage and update the application's state in a predictable and centralized manner. 

    Action: An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes a change in the application's state. 
            It typically has a type property that indicates the type of action and may contain 
            additional data payload. 
            
    State Update: When you dispatch an action, the reducer function processes it, and based on the 
                    action type, it returns a new state object. React then re-renders your components 
                    with the updated state, reflecting the changes in your UI.


    # i wll have to export actions
     const {addItems, removeItems} = cartSlice.actions;

    export default cartSlice.reducer;



    put that SLice into Store

        - {
            reducer:{
                cart: cart: cartSlice,
